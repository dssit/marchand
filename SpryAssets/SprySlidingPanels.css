 * this selector does not set the overflow property since that is done programatically
 * by the widget. Setting the overflow property programatically ensures that
 * the contens of the widget will be fully visible should JavaScript be disabled
 * in the browser.
 *
 * If you want to constrain the width of the SlidingPanels widget, set a width on
 * the SlidingPanels container. By default, our sliding panels widget expands
 * horizontally to fill up available space.
 *
 * The SlidingPanels container is positioned relative so that content inside it
 * can be positioned relative to its upper left corner.
 *
 * Avoid placing any CSS border or padding properties on the SlidingPanels container
 * as they can affect the proper positioning and sliding animations of the contents
 * inside the container.
 *
 * The name of the class ("SlidingPanels") used in this selector is not necessary
 * to make the widget function. You can use any class name you want to style the
 * SlidingPanels container.

 * You can make the panels within the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container layout
 * horizontally by giving the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container a width that is as wide
 * or larget than the sum of the widths of all of the content panels, and then floating
 * the content panels inside the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container so they all appear
 * on the same line. You may also need to float the SlidingPanels and SlidingPanelsContentGroup
 * containers to insure that none of the content panels "leak" outside of the widget.

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.
